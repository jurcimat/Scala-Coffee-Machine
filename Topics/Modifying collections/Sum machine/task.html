<h2>Sum machine!</h2>
<p>Robot wants to emulate simple calculation of expressions: first, it defines variables, and then adds them up. With a limited amount of resources, Robot has a bunch of special conditions.</p>

<p>It can work with definitions like <code class="java">a=5,b=10</code> so that in one input line, each definition contains a string name of a variable, an equals sign, and an integer value. It is possible to define several variables with a comma as a separator. The calculated sum expression is defined in the next input string in the format <code class="java">a+b</code> with the names of variables separated by a plus sign. It is allowed to use undefined variable names in the expression: in this case, the value of the variable will be 0. </p>

<p>Help Robot finish the program!</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">a=1,b=2,c=3<br>a+b+c<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">6<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 9 seconds</font><br><br>
